'''
Code as fast as you can! You need to double the integer and return it.
Here's one way:
```python
def double_integer(num):
result = num * 2
return result

'''

def double_integer(cb):
    pass # Double the integer and return it!
    return cb*2
print('here is the double of 3 is : ' + str(double_integer(3)))
#   -> here is the double of 3 is : 6
